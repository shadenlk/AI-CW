# Breast Cancer Image Classifier

A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based project for classifying breast ultrasound images as **malignant** or **benign/normal**, developed as part of the COM2028 Artificial Intelligence module.

This project uses the [BreastMNIST](https://medmnist.com/) dataset and explores deep learning techniques, model evaluation metrics, and transfer learning with ResNet18.
